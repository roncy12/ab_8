Cannabis plants produce cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the precursor to the three main cannabinoid lines: tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and cannabichromenic acid (CBCA).</p>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"color-h4\">CBG's Potential Benefits.</h4>\r\n                            <p  class=\"size-p\">The human body’s built-in endocannabinoid system (ECS) works to keep the body in its balanced state of homeostasis. While there are specific details about how cannabinoids work, in general the endocannabinoid system performs different functions specific to each area of the body.</p>    \r\n                            <h4 class=\"color-h4\">What is CBG:</h4>\r\n                            <p  class=\"size-p\">Cannabigerol is one of more than 120 identified cannabinoid compounds found in the plant genus Cannabis. Cannabigerol is the decarboxylated form of cannabigerolic acid, the parent molecule from which other cannabinoids are synthesized. Cannabigerol is a minor constituent of cannabis.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>   \r\n            \r\n            <!-- Why Choose Us -->\r\n            <div class=\"row properties-cbd row-reverse w-100 position-relative mx-0 row-sub-categ\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-2 px-0\">\r\n                    <img src=\"{{cdn 'https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-2r0p327be1/product_images/uploaded_images/cbd-cbg-lipo.png?t=1635474580&_gl=1*isqrnt*_ga*MTgzNTE5MzI1My4xNjE3Nzc3MjAy*_ga_WS2VZYPC6G*MTYzNTQ2Nzk4MS4zMjYuMS4xNjM1NDc0NjcwLjQx'}}\">\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 position-relative cbd-properties sub-categ\">\r\n                    <div class=\"abs-con w-70 sec\">                     \r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"font-h4\">\r\n                            <h4 class=\"color-h4\">FULL SPECTRUM <br>VS BROAD SPECTRUM</h4>\r\n                            <p class=\"size-p\">Similar to the full spectrum entourage effect, our Superior Broad Spectrum CBD formula also offers a whole-body experience – just minus any THC. And like full spectrum CBD, our specialized Superior Broad Spectrum retains all of the helpful cannabinoids from its extraction, including terpenes and flavonoids; but it removes any trace amounts of THC, allowing the entourage effect without any additional worries or risks. Whether you decide to use our Superior Broad Spectrum formula or our other brand-new full spectrum CBD oil will depend on your personal preference. Each one has its benefits depending on why you’re using it. Both of them offer a whole-plant impact, which is far more significant than CBD isolate; however, our full spectrum CBD includes minimal THC content, while our Superior Broad Spectrum is THC-free.* To learn even more about the differences, check out our in-depth analysis, “The Difference Between Full Spectrum and Broad Spectrum CBD.”</p>\r\n                           \r\n                        </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>   \r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <!-- Frequently Asked Question -->\r\n\r\n            <h2 class=\"h4-faqs pt-2 mx-auto\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n            <button class=\"custom-accordion\">\r\n                <div>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR CBD OIL TINCTURES TO WORK?</div>\r\n                <div><svg class=\"icon accordion-indicator toggleLink-text toggleLink-text--off\">\r\n                <use xlink:href=\"#icon-plus\"> </use>\r\n                </svg></div>\r\n            </button>\r\n            <div class=\"panel\">\r\n              <p>Everyone's body is different.
