It is the wall that surrounds the cell and keeps bad things out and good things in. This membrane is made up of two layers of phospholipids, a phospholipid bi-layer. Phospholipids are basically just phosphorus molecules connected to the end of fat molecules. Liposomes are tiny spheres made from cholesterol and naturally-occurring phospholipids. These spheres can surround certain types of compounds and nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E, CoQ10 and CBD and when they enter or come in contact with the cells of the body they are able to feed the cell membranes with the phospholipids and deliver the nutrients contained within them directly to the cells.</p>    \r\n                    \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>   \r\n            \r\n            <!-- Why Choose Us -->\r\n            <div class=\"row properties-cbd row-reverse w-100 position-relative mx-0 row-sub-categ\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-2 px-0\">\r\n                    <img src=\"{{cdn 'https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-2r0p327be1/product_images/uploaded_images/cbd-liposomal-right.png?t=1635393378&_gl=1*117omhc*_ga*MTgzNTE5MzI1My4xNjE3Nzc3MjAy*_ga_WS2VZYPC6G*MTYzNTM5MTU3MS4zMjAuMS4xNjM1MzkxODIwLjU4'}}\">\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 position-relative cbd-properties sub-categ\">\r\n                    <div class=\"abs-con w-70\">                     \r\n                        <h4 class=\"choose-h4\">Why Choose Us?</h4>\r\n                        <div class=\"font-h4\">\r\n                            <h4 class=\"color-h4\">A SUPERIOR HEMP EXTRACT DELIVERY SYSTEM</h4>\r\n                            <p class=\"size-p\">The delivery method represents a breakthrough in hemp extract consumption.
