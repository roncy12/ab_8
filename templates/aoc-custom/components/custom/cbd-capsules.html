                                The primary advantage of CBD oil capsules is the ease with which users can measure their intake. While CBD products like tinctures can be measured out there is always a small amount of variation between each serving. With CBD oil capsules, you can eliminate the guesswork, knowing exactly how much CBD oil is in each capsule. They are easily transportable and make a good option for people who need to take CBD on the go.

                                CBD oil capsules are an easy, measured way to get your daily CBD - all you need is a glass of water. Recommended intake method is simply taking the pill orally with a beverage to help wash it down at the same time each day.

                            <p class="size-p">There are many CBD capsules for sale out there, our curated selection includes the only brand that uses a proprietary Superior Broad Spectrum CBD formula.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-h4">CBD TINCTURES VS. CBD CAPSULES</h4>
                            <p  class="size-p">CBD tinctures and CBD oil capsules are both great for a daily CBD routine, delivering Superior Broad Spectrum CBD formula with few extra ingredients. So why choose one over the other?</p>
                            <p  class="size-p">CBD tinctures can be faster-acting if you take the CBD oil under your tongue and absorb it through the membrane. With that method you might feel the effects faster, compared to a slower release with ingested CBD.</p>
                            <p class="size-p">
                                However, to do that, you need to hold the oil in your mouth for up to 60 seconds before swallowing, so a CBD oil pill is usually faster to actually take - simply swallow the capsule with a sip of water. Moreover, while you have to follow the quantity of tincture that you take carefully, each CBD capsule and softgel has a precisely measured amount of CBD in it, so you can easily keep track of how much you're taking.  
                            </p>
                            <p class="size-p">
                                CBD tablets also don't have the spill risk of oils, so they're suitable for taking with you on the go.
